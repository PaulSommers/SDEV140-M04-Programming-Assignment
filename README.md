# SDEV140-M04-Programming-Assignment
 
This project is composed of two parts:

Part 1:
This program prompts the user to enter a number greater than 1 and displays all prime numbers less than or equal to the number.  It creates a list of all the numbers between 2 and the number the user entered, and then it loops trough this list checking each number to see if its prime or not (and outputting it if it is).

Part 2:
This program takes a dictionary of items and their prices, and displays the top three most expensive items.
